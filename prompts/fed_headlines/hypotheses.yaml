# NLI hypothesis strings for the fed_headlines labeling task.

# Each label maps to a natural-language hypothesis that should be entailed
# by texts assigned to that label. Used by NLIScorer for model-independent
# coherence verification.

# Label scale:
#   -99 = irrelevant (no monetary policy signal)
#   -2  = strongly dovish
#   -1  = somewhat dovish
#    0  = neutral
#    1  = somewhat hawkish
#    2  = strongly hawkish
