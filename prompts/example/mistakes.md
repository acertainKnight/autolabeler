# Common Mistakes to Avoid

These are the most frequent labeling errors on this task. Review these before labeling.

---

## Mistake 1: [Name of the mistake]

**What happens:** [Describe what annotators incorrectly do]

**Why it's wrong:** [Explain]

**Correct approach:**
- ❌ "[Example of the mistake]" → labeled **[WRONG LABEL]** (incorrect)
- ✅ "[Same example]" → correctly labeled **[CORRECT LABEL]**

---

## Mistake 2: [Name of the mistake]

**What happens:** [Describe]

**Why it's wrong:** [Explain]

**Correct approach:**
- ❌ "[Example]" → labeled **[WRONG LABEL]** (incorrect)
- ✅ "[Example]" → correctly labeled **[CORRECT LABEL]**

## Mistake 3: Ignoring [Key Signal Type]

**What happens:** Annotators overlook [specific linguistic marker / contextual cue] and default to the wrong label.

**Rule:** [Cite the relevant rule from rules.md]

**Examples:**
- "[Text with the easily missed signal]" → **[CORRECT LABEL]**, not **[WRONG LABEL]**
- "[Another example]" → **[CORRECT LABEL]**

## Mistake 4: Overusing the Default Label

**What happens:** When uncertain, annotators label everything **[DEFAULT LABEL]** even when a clear signal is present.

**Guidance:** If you can identify [specific type of signal], use [LABEL] even if other parts of the text seem neutral.

## Mistake 5: Confusing [LABEL_A] and [LABEL_B]

The boundary between [LABEL_A] and [LABEL_B] is the most common source of disagreement.

**[LABEL_A]** requires: [specific condition]
**[LABEL_B]** requires: [specific condition]

| This is [LABEL_A] | This is [LABEL_B] |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "[Example]" | "[Example]" |
| "[Example]" | "[Example]" |
