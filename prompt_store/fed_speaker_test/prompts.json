Your task is to identify who is speaking or being quoted in each headline and return their lowercase lastname.\n\n## Task: Speaker Identification\n\nYou need to extract the speaker's lastname (in lowercase) from Federal Reserve communications headlines.\n\n### Common Patterns to Look For:\n\n1. **FED Format** (very common): \"*FED'S [LASTNAME] SAYS...\" \u2192 lastname\n2. **Simple Format** (very common): \"*[LASTNAME] SAYS...\" \u2192 lastname\n3. **FED Action Format**: \"*FED'S [LASTNAME] SEES...\" or \"*FED'S [LASTNAME] [ACTION]...\" \u2192 lastname\n4. **Title Format**: \"*[TITLE] [FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME] SAYS...\" \u2192 lastname\n5. **Complex Format**: \"*[ORGANIZATION]'S [LASTNAME] [ACTION]...\" \u2192 lastname\n6. **Action Format**: \"*[LASTNAME] SEES...\" or \"*[LASTNAME] [OTHER_ACTION]...\" \u2192 lastname\n\n### Specific Guidelines:\n\n- **Extract only the lastname** of the person speaking or being quoted\n- **Return in lowercase** (e.g., \"bernanke\", \"yellen\", \"powell\")\n- **Federal Reserve Officials**: Look for titles like \"FED'S\", \"FEDERAL RESERVE'S\", Fed governors, regional bank presidents\n- **Multiple speakers**: If multiple people are mentioned, extract the primary speaker (usually first mentioned)\n- **No clear speaker**: If no individual speaker is identifiable, return \"unknown\" unless the \"speaker\" is the Fed itself.\n\n### Examples:\n\n- \"*FED'S ROSENGREN SAYS ECONOMY MAY IMPROVE...\" \u2192 \"rosengren\"\n- \"*BERNANKE SAYS MAY SEE SOME STABILIZATION...\" \u2192 \"bernanke\"\n- \"*FED'S LOCKHART SEES ENCOURAGING SIGNS...\" \u2192 \"lockhart\"\n- \"*CHICAGO FED'S EVANS SEES WEAK CONSTRUCTION...\" \u2192 \"evans\"\n- \"*SENATOR SHELBY SAYS HE OPPOSES SECOND TERM FOR BERNANKE...\" \u2192 \"shelby\"\n- \"*TREASURIES RISE; FED'S ROSENGREN SAYS RECOVERY...\" \u2192 \"rosengren\"\n\n\n\n## Task: Extract Speaker Information\n**Headline:** *FED'S KOHN, FDIC'S BOVENZI COMPLETE HOUSE PANEL TESTIMONY\n\n**Your task:** Extract the speaker's lastname from this Federal Reserve headline and provide it in the \"label\" field.\n\n**Instructions:**\n- **label**: Put the speaker's lastname in lowercase (e.g., \"bernanke\", \"yellen\", \"powell\"). If no clear speaker, use \"unknown\".\n- **confidence**: Provide a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 for your identification.\n- **reasoning**: Brief explanation of how you identified the speaker and which pattern you used.\n\n**Remember:**\n- Focus on the person who is speaking or being quoted\n- Return only the lastname in lowercase\n- If multiple people are mentioned, choose the primary speaker (usually first mentioned or directly quoted)\n- Use \"unknown\" only if no individual speaker can be identified",
