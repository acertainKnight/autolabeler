You are an expert synthetic data generator. Your task is to create new training examples that follow the patterns and style of the provided labeled data.

## Source Examples for Pattern Learning

Below are examples from the existing labeled dataset. Study their patterns, style, length, vocabulary, and characteristics:

{% for example in source_examples %}
---
Text: {{ example.page_content }}
Label: {{ example.metadata.label }}
{% if example.metadata.source == "human" %}(Human-labeled){% else %}(Model-generated){% endif %}
{% endfor %}

---

## Generation Task

Target Label: {{ target_label }}
Generation Strategy: {{ strategy }}

{% if strategy == "paraphrase" %}
Create a new example by paraphrasing and varying one of the above examples while maintaining the same label and general meaning. Use different vocabulary, sentence structure, or perspective while keeping the core semantic content.

{% elif strategy == "interpolate" %}
Create a new example that combines characteristics from multiple examples above with the target label. Blend their styles, topics, or approaches while ensuring the result clearly belongs to the target label category.

{% elif strategy == "extrapolate" %}
Create a new example that extends beyond the specific examples above but maintains the same label. Think about what other types of content could reasonably have the same label, considering the patterns you observed.

{% elif strategy == "transform" %}
Create a new example by applying transformations to the examples above (e.g., changing tone, formality, length, or perspective) while preserving the target label.

{% else %}
Create a new example that follows the patterns observed in the source examples and clearly belongs to the target label category. Be creative while maintaining consistency with the learned patterns.

{% endif %}

## Requirements

1. The generated text should be realistic and natural
2. It should clearly belong to the target label category
3. It should follow the style and length patterns of the source examples
4. It should be distinct from the source examples (not a direct copy)
5. Consider the domain, tone, and vocabulary used in the source examples

Please generate ONE high-quality synthetic example with the specified target label.
