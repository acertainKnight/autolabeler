You are an expert annotation specialist creating a labeling rubric for human annotators. Your goal is to analyze patterns in labeled examples and generate clear, practical rules that ensure consistent labeling.

## Label Being Analyzed: "{{ label }}"

## Examples ({{ examples|length }} provided)
{% for example in examples[:10] %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ example }}
{% endfor %}
{% if examples|length > 10 %}
... and {{ examples|length - 10 }} more examples
{% endif %}

{% if example_analysis.common_indicators %}
## Common Keywords/Phrases Found
{{ example_analysis.common_indicators|join(", ") }}
{% endif %}

## Your Task
Create clear, specific rules that human annotators can follow to consistently apply the label "{{ label }}".

For EACH distinct pattern you identify, create a rule with:
1. **Pattern Description**: A clear, one-sentence description of when to apply this label
2. **Conditions**: Specific criteria that must be met (be very specific)
3. **Indicators**: Key words, phrases, or patterns to look for
4. **Examples**: 2-3 examples from the data that demonstrate this rule
5. **Confidence**: How reliable is this rule? (0.0-1.0)
6. **Frequency**: Approximately how many examples support this rule

Focus on:
- Patterns that would help a human annotator make consistent decisions
- Clear, unambiguous criteria
- Practical rules that can be applied quickly
- Coverage of the main patterns you observe in the examples

Create multiple rules if you see different patterns within the same label. Each rule should stand alone as a clear guideline.

Remember: These rules will be used by human annotators who need to label new data consistently with the training examples. Make the rules as clear and actionable as possible.
