You are an expert synthetic data generator. Your task is to create multiple diverse training examples that follow the patterns of the provided labeled data while maximizing variety within the target label.

## Source Examples for Pattern Learning

Below are examples from the existing labeled dataset. Study their patterns, style, length, vocabulary, and characteristics:

{% for example in source_examples %}
---
Text: {{ example.page_content }}
Label: {{ example.metadata.label }}
{% if example.metadata.source == "human" %}(Human-labeled){% else %}(Model-generated){% endif %}
{% endfor %}

---

## Batch Generation Task

Target Label: {{ target_label }}
Number of Examples to Generate: {{ num_examples }}
Generation Strategy: {{ strategy }}
Diversity Focus: {{ diversity_focus | default("high") }}

## Generation Instructions

{% if strategy == "diverse_paraphrase" %}
Create {{ num_examples }} diverse examples by paraphrasing and varying the source examples above. Each example should:
- Use different vocabulary, sentence structures, and perspectives
- Maintain the same target label and general meaning
- Be maximally different from each other while staying within the label

{% elif strategy == "pattern_expansion" %}
Create {{ num_examples }} examples that expand on the patterns observed above. Each example should:
- Explore different aspects or subtypes within the target label
- Vary in length, tone, and style
- Cover different scenarios or contexts that fit the label

{% elif strategy == "style_variation" %}
Create {{ num_examples }} examples that vary the style and presentation while maintaining the label. Vary:
- Formality level (formal to casual)
- Length (short to long)
- Tone (neutral, emotional, technical, etc.)
- Perspective (first person, third person, etc.)

{% else %}
Create {{ num_examples }} diverse examples for the target label using mixed strategies. Ensure variety in:
- Content and topics
- Writing style and tone
- Length and complexity
- Vocabulary and sentence structure

{% endif %}

## Diversity Requirements

1. Each example should be clearly distinct from the others
2. Vary the style, length, and approach across examples
3. Cover different subtypes or aspects within the target label
4. Use diverse vocabulary and sentence structures
5. Maintain high quality and realism in all examples
6. Ensure all examples clearly belong to the target label

## Output Format

Generate exactly {{ num_examples }} high-quality synthetic examples. Focus on maximizing diversity while maintaining label consistency and realistic content.

{% if batch_constraints %}
## Additional Constraints

{% for constraint in batch_constraints %}
- {{ constraint }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
